This section imports the necessary dependencies for the application:

asynccontextmanager from contextlib: a decorator used to define a factory function for asynchronous context managers.
FastAPI from fastapi: the main class for creating a FastAPI application instance.
CORSMiddleware from fastapi.middleware.cors: a middleware class for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requests.
uvicorn: an ASGI web server implementation for Python.
SERVER_URL, PORT, and ENV from constants: these are likely configuration variables stored in a separate constants module.



Defining the Lifespan Context Manager

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    yield
This section defines a custom lifespan context manager using the asynccontextmanager decorator. 
The lifespan function takes a FastAPI application instance as an argument and yields control to the caller.

In the context of FastAPI, a lifespan context manager is used to manage the application's startup and shutdown events. 
The lifespan function is called when the application starts, and it yields control to the caller. When the application shuts down, 
the lifespan function resumes execution after the yield statement.

In this specific implementation, 
the lifespan function does not perform any specific actions during startup or shutdown. 
The yield statement simply passes control to the caller, allowing the application to run.








CORS or "Cross-Origin Resource Sharing" refers to the situations when a frontend running in a browser has JavaScript code that communicates with a backend, and the backend is in a different "origin" than the frontend.

OriginÂ¶
An origin is the combination of protocol (http, https), domain (myapp.com, localhost, localhost.tiangolo.com), and port (80, 443, 8080).

So, all these are different origins:

http://localhost
https://localhost
http://localhost:8080
Even if they are all in localhost, they use different protocols or ports, so, they are different "origins".



The CORS settings are configured as follows:

allow_origins=["*"]: allows requests from all origins (domains, protocols, or ports). In a production environment, you should specify a list of trusted origins instead of using the wildcard *.
allow_credentials=True: allows the browser to send credentials (e.g., cookies, authentication tokens) with requests.
allow_methods=["*"]: allows all HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
allow_headers=["*"]: allows all headers in requests.
By adding this CORS middleware, the FastAPI application will include the necessary CORS headers in its responses, allowing cross-origin requests from web browsers.

This section sets up the application to run using the Uvicorn web server. The if __name__ == '__main__':
 block is a common Python idiom that ensures the code within the block is only executed when the script is run directly (i.e., not when it's imported as a module by another script).

The uvicorn.run() function is used to run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn. The arguments passed to uvicorn.run() are:

"main:app": the module and object to run (in this case, the app object from the main module).
host=SERVER_URL: the host to bind the server to (e.g., localhost, 0.0.0.0, etc.).
port=int(PORT): the port to bind the server to (e.g., 8000, 5000, etc.).
reload=(ENV=='dev'): a boolean indicating whether to enable automatic reloading of the application when the code changes. 
In this case, reloading is enabled only when the ENV variable is set to 'dev'.
By running the application with Uvicorn, the FastAPI application will be served at the specified host and port, and will 
automatically reload when the code changes (if ENV is set to 'dev').
